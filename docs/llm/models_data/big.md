## Summary of "GPQA: A Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark"

### Abstract

GPQA (Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark) is a dataset of 448 challenging multiple-choice questions in biology, physics, and chemistry. These questions, written by domain experts, are designed to be extremely difficult. Experts with PhDs in the respective fields achieve a 65% accuracy rate, while non-experts with access to the internet only achieve 34%. GPT-4, a state-of-the-art AI, reaches 39% accuracy. The purpose of GPQA is to enable the development of scalable oversight methods for AI systems that help humans advance scientific knowledge.

### Introduction

The rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities suggest that AI could soon help in advancing human knowledge. However, aligning models to ensure they provide truthful information, especially on questions beyond human verification, remains a challenge. GPQA aims to serve as a testbed for scalable oversight methods, ensuring that even highly skilled non-experts cannot solve these questions easily, making it suitable for future AI evaluation.

### Data Collection

GPQA consists of questions written by domain experts who are either pursuing or have completed a PhD. The collection process involves four main stages: question writing, expert validation, question revision, and non-expert validation. This process ensures the questions are difficult, objective, and vetted by experts in the field.

#### Collection Pipeline

1. **Question Writing**: Experts write challenging questions within their domain, ensuring other experts can answer them without needing the multiple-choice options.
2. **Expert Validation**: Another expert in the same domain validates the question, providing feedback and suggested revisions.
3. **Question Revision**: The question writer revises the question based on the first expert’s feedback.
4. **Second Expert Validation**: A second expert validates the revised question. Feedback from this step helps in judging the objectivity of the question.
5. **Non-Expert Validation**: Non-experts, skilled in other domains, attempt to answer the questions. They have unrestricted internet access but cannot use LLM assistants.

### Domains and Subdomains

GPQA covers three main domains: biology, physics, and chemistry, with questions further categorized into specific subdomains:

- **Biology**: Molecular Biology, Genetics
- **Physics**: Quantum Mechanics, High-Energy Particle Physics, Astrophysics, Electromagnetism and Photonics, among others.
- **Chemistry**: Organic Chemistry, General Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry

## HumanEval Dataset: Definition and Examples

### Introduction
The HumanEval dataset is a set of 164 hand-written programming problems designed to evaluate the functional correctness of code generated by language models. Each problem includes a function signature, a docstring, the function body, and several unit tests. This dataset is critical for benchmarking models like Codex, which are trained to generate code from natural language specifications.

### Dataset Structure
Each problem in the HumanEval dataset has the following components:
1. **Function Signature**: Defines the function's input parameters and return type.
2. **Docstring**: Provides a description of the function's purpose and the expected behavior.
3. **Body**: Contains the code implementation, which the model is supposed to generate.
4. **Unit Tests**: A set of tests to validate the correctness of the generated code, averaging 7.7 tests per problem.

### Purpose
The primary goal of the HumanEval dataset is to measure the functional correctness of code generation models. Functional correctness is evaluated based on whether the generated code passes all provided unit tests, rather than relying on match-based metrics like BLEU score, which may not fully capture the semantic accuracy of the code.

### Evaluation Metric: Pass@k
The evaluation uses the pass@k metric, where k represents the number of code samples generated per problem. A problem is considered solved if any of the k samples pass the unit tests. The pass@k metric provides a more accurate measure of a model's ability to generate functionally correct code compared to traditional metrics.

#### Pass@k Calculation
To calculate pass@k, n samples are generated for each task, where n ≥ k. The number of correct samples (c) that pass the unit tests is counted, and the pass@k metric is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{pass@k} = E_{\text{Problems}} \left[ 1 - \frac{\binom{n-c}{k}}{\binom{n}{k}} \right] \]

This formula ensures an unbiased estimation of the pass@k metric.

### Example Problems from HumanEval
The HumanEval dataset covers a variety of programming tasks, including language comprehension, algorithms, and basic mathematics. Here are three example problems from the dataset:

#### Example 1: Simple Arithmetic
**Docstring**:
```python
"""
Write a function to add two numbers.
"""
```
**Function Signature**:
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
```
**Unit Tests**:
```python
assert add(2, 3) == 5
assert add(-1, 1) == 0
assert add(0, 0) == 0
```

#### Example 2: String Manipulation
**Docstring**:
```python
"""
Reverse the input string.
"""
```
**Function Signature**:
```python
def reverse_string(s: str) -> str:
```
**Unit Tests**:
```python
assert reverse_string("hello") == "olleh"
assert reverse_string("abcd") == "dcba"
assert reverse_string("") == ""
```

#### Example 3: Factorial Calculation
**Docstring**:
```python
"""
Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.
"""
```
**Function Signature**:
```python
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
```
**Unit Tests**:
```python
assert factorial(5) == 120
assert factorial(0) == 1
assert factorial(3) == 6
```

### Summary of "Instruction-Following Evaluation for Large Language Models"

#### Abstract
The paper introduces Instruction-Following Eval (IFEval), a benchmark for evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions. Traditional human evaluations are costly and subjective, while LLM-based auto-evaluations are biased. IFEval focuses on "verifiable instructions" which are objectively checkable, such as word count limits or specific keywords. The benchmark includes 25 types of verifiable instructions and 500 prompts. Evaluation results for models like GPT-4 and PaLM 2 are presented, and the resources are available on GitHub.

#### Introduction
LLMs are essential for many modern applications. Their ability to follow natural language instructions accurately is crucial for task precision and reliability, particularly in sensitive areas like healthcare. Evaluating this capability is challenging due to the subjective nature of language. Existing methods include human evaluation, model-based evaluation, and quantitative benchmarks, each with drawbacks. IFEval offers a reproducible, unbiased, and automatic evaluation method using verifiable instructions to ensure objectivity.

#### Verifiable Instructions
The paper lists 25 verifiable instructions, categorized based on keywords, language, length constraints, detectable content, format, combinations, case changes, and punctuation. Examples include ensuring a certain word count, using specific keywords, and formatting responses in JSON. This structured approach allows for clear and objective evaluation of whether LLMs follow instructions.

| Instruction Group | Instruction Description |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Keywords | Include specific keywords a certain number of times or avoid certain words. |
| Language | Respond in a specified language. |
| Length Constraints | Meet specified word, sentence, or paragraph counts. |
| Detectable Content | Include specific markers or placeholders in the response. |
| Detectable Format | Use specific formats such as bullet points, titles, or sections. |
| Combination | Combine multiple instructions in a response. |
| Change Cases | Use all uppercase or lowercase letters. |
| Punctuation | Avoid using certain punctuation marks. |

#### Prompt Synthesis
Prompts were generated through few-shot prompting and manual curation. Base prompts were combined with one to three verifiable instructions. Few-shot prompting helped identify illogical prompts, and rephrasing increased diversity. Manual checks ensured logical consistency.

#### IFEval Metrics
Instruction-following accuracy is measured using strict and loose metrics. The strict metric checks exact compliance, while the loose metric accounts for common variations in responses, reducing false negatives. This dual approach balances precision and flexibility.

#### Evaluation Results
IFEval was used to evaluate GPT-4 and PaLM 2 models. Four accuracy scores were calculated: prompt-level and instruction-level, both strict and loose. GPT-4 generally outperformed PaLM 2 across most categories.

| Model | Prompt-level strict accuracy (%) | Instruction-level strict accuracy (%) | Prompt-level loose accuracy (%) | Instruction-level loose accuracy (%) |
|-------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| GPT-4 | 76.89 | 83.57 | 79.30 | 85.37 |
| PaLM 2 S | 43.07 | 55.76 | 46.95 | 59.11 |

#### Discussion and Future Work
IFEval provides a standardized method for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities. Future work will expand the diversity and quantity of instructions and extend the approach to multi-modal use cases.

#### Appendix
The appendix includes detailed accuracy results and a comprehensive list of prompts used in the evaluation.

| Prompt Example | Verifiable Instructions |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Who built the first artificial ice rink? Include the keys (1) Name (2) Location and (3) Year. Use less than 487 words. | Ensure specific keys and word count. |
| Write a song about regrets in the style of Taylor Swift. Please include explanations for the lyrics you write. Make sure your entire response is in English, and in all capital letters. | Maintain specific format and language constraints. |

This summary provides an overview of the paper's structure and findings. The detailed evaluation methodology, prompt synthesis process, and results demonstrate the effectiveness of IFEval in objectively assessing LLMs' instruction-following abilities. Future improvements aim to broaden the benchmark's applicability and enhance its real-world relevance.

### Summary of "Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding"

**Abstract:**
The paper introduces a new benchmark to measure the multitask accuracy of text models across 57 tasks spanning various domains such as mathematics, history, computer science, and law. The results show that while large models like GPT-3 outperform random chance, there is a significant gap between their performance and expert-level accuracy. The paper highlights the limitations of current models, especially in socially important subjects like morality and law, and suggests the new benchmark can help in identifying these shortcomings.

**1. Introduction:**
- NLP models have achieved superhuman performance on many benchmarks but still lag in overall language understanding.
- Existing benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE focus more on linguistic skills than comprehensive knowledge.
- Transformer models pretrained on vast text corpora have vast domain knowledge, but their real-world application capabilities remain untested.
- A new benchmark evaluates models on 57 subjects, ranging from elementary to advanced professional levels, to measure knowledge and problem-solving abilities.

**2. Related Work:**
- **Pretraining:** Large models are pretrained on massive text corpora, exposing them to a wide range of topics.
- **Benchmarks:** Recent benchmarks focus on commonsense reasoning, but models have quickly approached human-level performance.
- **Need for a New Benchmark:** Current benchmarks do not cover the wide-ranging knowledge required for real-world applications.

**3. A Multitask Test:**
- The test includes multiple-choice questions from humanities, social sciences, STEM, and other areas.
- Questions were manually collected from online sources, including practice exams for various professional tests.
- The dataset has 15,908 questions split into a few-shot development set, a validation set, and a test set.

**3.1 Humanities:**
- Includes law, philosophy, history, etc.
- Tests require understanding complex scenarios and applying appropriate precedents.

**3.2 Social Science:**
- Covers economics, sociology, psychology, etc.
- Questions require a mixture of world knowledge, qualitative reasoning, and quantitative reasoning.

**3.3 STEM:**
- Includes physics, computer science, mathematics, etc.
- Questions test conceptual understanding and problem-solving abilities at various levels.

**3.4 Other:**
- Includes professional medicine, business topics, and global facts.
- Questions require specialized knowledge and understanding.

**4. Experiments:**
- **Setup:** Evaluated GPT-3 and UnifiedQA models.
- **Model Sizes:** GPT-3 models range from 2.7 billion to 175 billion parameters.
- **Few-Shot Prompt:** Models are tested with few-shot learning, providing a few example questions and answers before the actual question.

**4.1 Results:**
- Larger models perform better, with GPT-3 X-Large achieving 43.9% accuracy.
- UnifiedQA, fine-tuned on other datasets, outperforms GPT-3 with an accuracy of 48.9%.
- Models have lopsided performance, excelling in some areas but performing poorly in others.

**4.2 Calibration:**
- Models are often miscalibrated, with confidence not correlating well with accuracy.

**5. Discussion:**
- **Multimodal Understanding:** Future benchmarks should include multimodal inputs.
- **Training Methods:** Models should learn from diverse text sources, similar to human learning.
- **Model Limitations:** Current models struggle with procedural knowledge and socially relevant subjects.

**6. Conclusion:**
- The new benchmark measures text models' knowledge across a broad range of subjects.
- Current models show progress but still have significant gaps, especially in socially important areas.
- The benchmark can help pinpoint model shortcomings and guide future research.
