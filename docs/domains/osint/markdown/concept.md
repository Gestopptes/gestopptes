### IDEA 1: OSI + RAG - Knowledge Graph and Lead Generation

#### Overview
This project involves using Open Source Intelligence (OSI) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate a comprehensive knowledge graph and lead generation system. The workflow will include automated search queries, information extraction, and user interaction to build and refine a knowledge base.

#### Process
1. **User Input:**
    - User specifies an event to investigate using three URLs containing specific filters or keywords.

2. **Automated Google Search:**
    - Generate 5 search queries based on user input.
    - Retrieve 20 pages of results per query, totaling 100 pages.

3. **Information Extraction:**
    - Extract fragmented narratives from the 100 pages using Named Entity Recognition (NER) with a Language Learning Model (LLM).
    - Extract LEAD:
        - **WHO**: Identify the main actors.
        - **WHAT**: Determine the main actions/events.
        - **WHEN**: Establish the timeline.
        - **WHERE**: Locate the events.
        - **WHY**: Understand the reasons/motivations.
    - Extract BODY:
        - **Evidence**: Gather supporting information.
        - **Quotes**: Collect direct quotes from resources.
        - **Media Objects**: Identify photos, videos, HTML DOM elements.
    - Extract TAIL:
        - **Opinion**: Capture opinions and viewpoints.
        - **Persuasion Tactics**: Analyze persuasive techniques.
        - **Sentiment/Mood**: Gauge the overall sentiment.

4. **Data Integration:**
    - Store results in Neo4j graph database.
    - Use LlamaIndex to integrate data with Neo4j.
    - Generate / maintain User-Editable Wiki Page (markdown) in sync with graph data.

5. **User Interaction:**
    - Users can correct or add information to the graph database.
    - Users can introduce new documents, triggering re-analysis and conflict reporting.

6. **Intelligence Reporting:**
    - Generate initial intelligence reports based on the inverted pyramid method (Lead, Body, Tail).
    - User comments and corrections are incorporated to refine the report.

7. **Wiki Site Generation:**
    - Create a user-readable knowledge base.
    - Enable user-editable markdown.
    - Generate Table of Contents and fact-checking pages.
    - Create Wikipedia-style pages for each actor and node in the Neo4j database.

#### Tools and Technologies
- Neo4j for graph database management.
- LlamaIndex for integrating data.
- NER and LLM for information extraction.
- Automated search and data retrieval mechanisms.

### IDEA 2: Self-Developing Software Bot

#### Overview
This project involves creating a software development bot capable of generating code, reviewing pull requests, and writing tests. The bot interacts with users to implement features, fix bugs, and review code, aiming to automate and streamline the development process.

#### Process
1. **Issue Implementation:**
    - User requests implementation of an issue.
    - Bot gathers issue information:
        - Bug description or feature details.
        - Code areas requiring modification.
        - Error logs (for bugs).
        - Steps to reproduce (for bugs).
        - Common sense info: Clear objective.
    - Steps:
        - Generate pull request variants with tests.
        - Ensure tests pass and perform a "common sense test" for solution validity.
        - User reviews and accepts/rejects pull request variants.
        - Mark issue as done upon user acceptance.

2. **Pull Request Review:**
    - User requests review of a pull request.
    - Bot retrieves PR info, including issue ID and code.
    - Bot performs code review and provides feedback to the user.

3. **Issue Creation:**
    - User requests help to create a new issue.
    - Chatbot interacts with the user to gather necessary information:
        - Description, details, code snippets, steps to reproduce, common sense info, and test examples.
    - Bot assists in formulating the issue documentation.

4. **Documentation Generation:**
    - Autogenerate documentation based on code changes and user input.
    - Ensure comprehensive and up-to-date documentation is maintained.

#### Tools and Technologies
- PYTHON 3.12
- Automated code generation and review mechanisms.
- Test generation tools.
- User-interactive chatbot for gathering issue details.
- Documentation tools for auto-generating project documentation.
